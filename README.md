# wmbusmeters

The program receives and decodes C1,T1 or S1 telegrams
(using the wireless mbus protocol or the wired mbus protocol) to acquire
utility meter readings. The readings can then be published using
MQTT, curled to a REST api, inserted into a database or stored in a log file.

[FAQ/WIKI/MANUAL pages](https://weetmuts.github.io/wmbusmeterswiki/)

The program runs on GNU/Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, and Raspberry Pi.

# Build from source and run as a daemon

Building and installing from source is easy and recommended since the
development progresses quickly.  First remove the wmbus dongle
(im871a,amb8465,amb3665,cul,rc1180) or the generic rtlsdr dongle (RTL2832U)
from your computer. Then do:

`./configure; make; sudo make install` will install wmbusmeters as a daemon.

# Usage

Check the contents of your `/etc/wmbusmeters.conf` file, assuming it
has `device=auto:t1` and you are using a im871a,amb8465,amb3665,rc1180,cul or rtlsdr device,
then you can now start the daemon with `sudo systemctl start wmbusmeters`
or you can try it from the command line `wmbusmeters auto:t1`

Wmbusmeters will scan for wmbus devices every few seconds and detect whenever
a device is plugged in or removed. However since wmbusmeters now supports
several dongle types, the scan can take some time!

Use `auto` for testing and to find your dongle. For production it is very much
recommended that you change `auto:t1` to the device name with the full device path
(eg `/dev/ttyUSB0:im871a:c1,t1`). This will skip the slow probing for all possible
wmbus dongles when wmbusmeters startup.

If the serial device (ttyUSB0) might change you can also use `device=im871a:c1,t1`
which will probe all serial devices but only scans for im871a which also speeds it up.

If you have to scan serial devices, then remember that some Raspberry PIs are upset when
random data is sent to `/dev/ttyAMA0` when it is configured in bluetooth mode.
To solve this, add `donotprobe=/dev/ttyAMA0`

To have the wmbusmeters daemon start automatically when the computer boots do:
`sudo systemctl enable wmbusmeters`

You can trigger a reload of the config files with `sudo killall -HUP wmbusmetersd`

(Note! make install only works for GNU/Linux. For MacOSX try to start
`wmbusmetersd /tmp/thepidfile` from a script instead.)

You can also start the daemon with another set of config files:
`wmbusmetersd --useconfig=/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters /tmp/thepidfile`

When using useconfig, the files/dir should be:
`/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters.conf` and the meters dir:
`/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters.d`

Check the config file /etc/wmbusmeters.conf and edit the device. For example:
`/dev/ttyUSB1:amb8465:c1,t1` or `im871a:c1,t1` or `im871a[457200101056]:t1`.

Adding a device like auto or im871a will trigger an automatic probe of all serial ttys
to auto find or to find on which tty the im871a resides.

If you specify a full device path like `/dev/ttyUSB0:im871a:c1` or `rtlwmbus` or `rtl433`
then it will not probe the serial devices. If you must be really sure that it will not probe something
you can add `donotprobe=/dev/ttyUSB0` or `donotprobe=all`.

You can specify combinations like: `device=rc1180:t1` `device=auto:c1`
to set the rc1180 dongle to t1 but any other auto-detected dongle to c1.

Some dongles have identifiers (im871a,amb8465,amb3665 and rtlsdrs) (for example: rtlsdr can be set with `rtl_eeprom -s myname`)
You might have two rtlsdr dongles, one attached to an antenna tuned to 433MHz and the other
attached to an antenna tuned for 868.95MHz, then a more complicated setup could look like this:

```
device=rtlwmbus[555555]:433M
device=rtlwmbus[112233]
device=/dev/ttyUSB0:im871a[00102759]:c1,t1
device=/dev/ttyUSB1:rc1180:t1
```

# Bus aliases and polling

To poll an C2/T2/S2 wireless meter or an wired m-bus meter you need to give the (w)mbus device a bus-alias, for example
here we pick the bus alias MAIN for the mbus using 2400 bps for all meters on this bus.
```
MAIN=/dev/ttyUSB0:mbus:2400
```
and here we pick the bus alias RADIOMAIN for an im871a dongle:
```
RADIOMAIN=/dev/ttyUSB1:im871a:c2
```

The bus alias is then used in the meter driver specification to specify which
bus the mbus poll request should be sent to.
```
wmbusmeters --pollinterval=60s MAIN=/dev/ttyUSB0:mbus:2400 MyTempMeter piigth:MAIN:mbus 12001932 NOKEY
```

# Example wmbusmeter.conf file

```ini
loglevel=normal
# You can use auto:t1 to find the device you have connected to your system.
# But do not use auto here since it will cause unnecessary and slow probing of the serial ports.
device=/dev/ttyUSB0:im871a:c1,t1
# And mbus
device=MAIN=/dev/ttyUSB1:mbus:2400
# But do not probe this serial tty.
donotprobe=/dev/ttyACM2
logtelegrams=false
format=json
meterfiles=/var/lib/wmbusmeters/meter_readings
meterfilesaction=overwrite
meterfilesnaming=name
meterfilestimestamp=day
logfile=/var/log/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters.log
shell=/usr/bin/mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t wmbusmeters/$METER_ID -m "$METER_JSON"
alarmshell=/usr/bin/mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t wmbusmeters_alarm -m "$ALARM_TYPE $ALARM_MESSAGE"
alarmtimeout=1h
alarmexpectedactivity=mon-sun(00-23)
ignoreduplicates=true
```

Then add a meter file in /etc/wmbusmeters.d/MyTapWater

```ini
name=MyTapWater
id=12345678
key=00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
driver=multical21
```

And an mbus meter file in /etc/wmbusmeters.d/MyTempHygro

```ini
name=MyTempHygro
id=11223344
driver=piigth:mbus
pollinterval=60s
```

# Important information about meter drivers and their names.

You can use `driver=auto` to have wmbusmeters automatically detect
and use the best driver for your meter, but you should >not< use auto in production.

You can find out which driver is recommended by running `wmbusmeters im871a:t1`.
This will print information like:
```
Received telegram from: 71727374
          manufacturer: (BMT) BMETERS, Italy (0x9b4)
                  type: Heat/Cooling load meter (0x0d) encrypted
                   ver: 0x0b
                driver: hydrocalm3
```

For production use it is very much recommended that you specify the exact driver
in the meter file. The reason is that new and better drivers might be developed
for your meter, where the keys and the content of the json might change.
Such new drivers are guaranteed to have a different driver name.
The auto look up will change to the new driver, but the old driver will still work.

So wmbusmeters strives to guarantee that if you have specified the driver name,
then wmbusmeters can be safely upgraded at any time. The json will not
change in an incompatible way. (The only allowed changes are: adding new fields
and changing the ordering.)

Now plugin your wmbus dongle.

Wmbusmeters should start automatically, check with `tail -f /var/log/syslog` and `tail -f /var/log/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters.log`
(If you are using an rtlsdr dongle, then make sure that either the binaries `/usr/bin/rtl_sdr` and
`/usr/bin/rtl_wmbus` exists and are executable. Or that the executable `rtl_sdr/rtl_wmbus` binaries
exists inside the same directory as the wmbusmeters executable. If not you will see the
error message `(rtlwmbus) error: when starting as daemon, wmbusmeters looked for .../rtl_wmbus and /usr/bin/rtl_wmbus, but found neither!`
and the daemon will refuse to start.)

The latest reading of the meter can also be found here: `/var/lib/wmbusmeters/meter_readings/MyTapWater`

You can use several ids using `id=1111111,2222222,3333333` or you can listen to all
meters of a certain type `id=*` or you can suffix with star `id=8765*` to match
all meters with a given prefix. If you supply at least one positive match rule, then you
can add negative match rules as well. For example `id=*,!2222*`
which will match all meter ids, except those that begin with 2222.

You can add the static json data `"address":"RoadenRd 456","city":"Stockholm"` to every json message with the
wmbusmeters.conf setting:

```ini
field_address=RoadenRd 456
field_city=Stockholm
```

If you add `field_floor=5` to the meter file `MyTapWater`, then you can have the meter tailored static json `"floor":"5"` added to telegrams handled by that particular meter. (The old prefix json_ still works.)

If you are running on a Raspberry PI with flash storage and you relay the data to
another computer using a shell command (`mosquitto_pub` or `curl` or similar) then you might want to remove `meterfiles` and `meterfilesaction` to minimize the writes to the local flash file system.

Also when using the Raspberry PI it can get confused by the serial ports, in particular the bluetooth port might come and
go as a serial tty depending on the config. Therefore it can be advantageous to use the auto device to find the proper tty
(eg /dev/ttyUSB0) and then specify this tty device explicitly in the config file, instead of using auto. This assumes that
you only have a single usb dongle otherwise the USB tty names can change depending on how and when the devices are
unplugged/replugged and the pi restarted. If you have multiple devies with different antennas, then you should instead
use donotprobe to avoid the ttys that can never have a wmbus dongle.

If you specify `--meterfilesaction=append --meterfilestimestamp=day` then wmbusmeters will append all todays received telegrams in for example the file `Water_2019-12-11`, the day after the telegrams will be recorded in `Water_2019-12-12`. You can change the resolution to day,hour,minute and micros. Micros means that every telegram gets their own file.

The purpose of the alarm shell and timeout is to notify you about
problems within wmbusmeters and the wmbus dongles, not the meters
themselves. Thus the timeout is for a dongle to receive some telegram
at all. It does not matter from which meter.

# Run using config files

If you cannot install as a daemon, then you can also start
wmbusmeters in your terminal using the config files in `/etc/wmbusmeters`.

```shell
wmbusmeters --useconfig=/etc
```

Or you can start wmbusmeters with your own config files:

```shell
wmbusmeters --useconfig=/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters
```

If you already have config with a device specified, and you want to use
the config with another device. You might have multiple meters in the config
that you want to listen to. Then you can add `--device` to override the settings
in the config. Like this:

```shell
wmbusmeters --useconfig=/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters --device=rtlwmbus
```

You must have both `--useconfig=` and `--device=` for it to work.

The files/dir should then be located here:
`/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters.conf` and
`/home/me/.config/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters.d`

The option `--useconfig=` can only be combined with a few other options: `--device= --listento= --exitafter= --oneshot= --silent --normal --verbose --debug --trace`

When running using config files then you can trigger a reload of the config files
using `sudo killall -HUP wmbusmetersd` or `killall -HUP wmbusmeters`
depending on if you are running as a daemon or not.

# Running without config files, good for experimentation and test.

```

As device you can use:

`auto:c1`, to have wmbusmeters probe for devices: im871a, amb8465, amb3665, cul, rc1180 or rtlsdr (spawns rtlwmbus).

`im871a:c1` to start all connected *im871a* devices in *c1* mode, ignore all other devices.

`/dev/ttyUSB1:amb8465:c1` to start only this device on this tty. Do not probe for other devices.

If you have two im871a you can supply both of them with their unique id:s and set different listening modes:
`im871a[12345678]:c1` `im871a[11223344]:t1`

You can also specify rtlwmbus and if you set the serial in the rtlsdr
dongle using `rtl_eeprom -s 1234` you can also refer to a specific
rtlsdr dongle like this `rtlwmbus[1234]`.

`/dev/ttyUSB0:amb8465`, if you have an amb8465 dongle assigned to ttyUSB0. Other suffixes are im871a,cul.

`/dev/ttyUSB0`, to have wmbusmeters auto-detect amb8465, amb3665, im871a, rc1180 or cul device.

`/dev/ttyUSB0:38400`, to have wmbusmeters set the baud rate to 38400 and listen for raw wmbus telegrams.
These telegrams are expected to have the data link layer crc bytes removed already!

`MAIN=/dev/ttyUSB0:mbus:2400`, assume ttyUSB0 is an serial to mbus-master converter.  The speed is set to 2400 bps.

`rtlwmbus`, to spawn the background process: `rtl_sdr -f 868.625M -s 1600000 - 2>/dev/null | rtl_wmbus -s`
for each attached rtlsdr dongle. This will listen to S1,T1 and C1 meters in parallel.

Note that this uses a noticeable amount of CPU time by rtl_wmbus.
You can therefore use a tailored rtl_wmbus command that is more suitable for your needs.

`rtlwmbus:CMD(<command line>)`, to specify the entire background
process command line that is expected to produce rtlwmbus compatible
output.
The command line cannot contain parentheses.
Likewise for rtl433.

Here is an example command line that reduces the rtl_wmbus CPU usage if you only need T1/C1 telegrams.
It disable S1 decoding (`-p s`) and trades lower cpu usage for reception performance (`-a`):

`rtlwmbus:CMD(rtl_sdr -f 868.95M -s 1600000 - 2>/dev/null | rtl_wmbus -p s -a)`

`rtlwmbus(ppm=17)`, to tune your rtlsdr dongle accordingly.
Use this to tune your dongle and at the same time listen to S1,T1 and C1.

`rtlwmbus:433M`, to tune to this fq instead.
This will listen to exactly to what is on this frequency.

`rtl433`, to spawn the background process: `rtl_433 -F csv -f 868.95M`

`rtl433(ppm=17)`, to tune your rtlsdr dongle accordingly.

`rtl433:433M`, to tune to this fq instead.

`stdin`, to read raw binary telegrams from stdin.
These telegrams are expected to have the data link layer crc bytes removed already!

`telegrams.bin`, to read raw wmbus telegrams from this file.
These telegrams are expected to have the data link layer crc bytes removed already!

`stdin:hex`, to read hex characters wmbus telegrams from stdin.
These telegrams are expected to have the data link layer crc bytes removed already!

`telegrams.txt:hex`, to read hex characters wmbus telegrams from this file.
These telegrams are expected to have the data link layer crc bytes removed already!

`stdin:rtlwmbus`, to read telegrams formatted using the rtlwmbus format from stdin. Works for rtl433 as well.

`telegrams.msg:rtlwmbus`, to read rtlwmbus formatted telegrams from this file. Works for rtl433 as well.

`simulation_abc.txt`, to read telegrams from the file (the file must have a name beginning with simulation_....)
expecting the same format that is the output from `--logtelegrams`. This format also supports replay with timing.
The telegrams are allowed to have valid dll crcs, which will be automatically stripped.

As meter quadruples you specify:

* `<meter_name>`: a mnemonic for this particular meter (!Must not contain a colon ':' character!)
* `<meter_driver>`: use `auto` or one of the supported meters (can be suffixed with: `:<bus_alias>` for selecting which bus where we should send the poll requests  `:<mode>` to specify which mode you expect the meter to use when transmitting)
* `<meter_id>`: an 8 digit mbus id, usually printed on the meter
* `<meter_key>`: an encryption key unique for the meter
  if the meter uses no encryption, then supply `NOKEY`

The wmbus dongle im871a can listen to either s1, c1 or t1.
However with the latest firmware version (0x15) im871a can
also listen to c1 and t1 telegrams at the same time.
(Use `--verbose` to see your dongles firmware version.)
If you have the older firmware you can download the upgrader here:
https://wireless-solutions.de/downloadfile/wireless-m-bus-software/

The amb8465 dongle can listen to either s1, c1 or t1. However it
can also listen to c1 and t1 at the same time.

With the latest rtlwmbus you can listen to s1, c1 and t1 at
the same time.

The cul dongle can listen to c1 and t1 at the same time, but only
if you specify c1! If you specify t1 or s1, then it will only listen to t1 or s1.

Imporant!!!! Note that the cul dongle is limited to shorter
telegrams. There is a firmware fix that allows somewhat longer,
but still not full length telegrams. This can be a serious blocker
if you want to receive long telegrams from advanced meters.
Read the wiki to find this firmware.

The rc1180 dongle can listen only to t1.

# Usage examples

```shell
wmbusmeters auto:c1
```

Listens for C1 telegrams using any of your available wmbus dongles:

                device: im871a[12345678]
                  rssi: -77 dBm
                driver: multical21
```

You can see that this telegram is encrypted and therefore you need a key.
Now listen to this specific meter, since the driver is auto-detected, we can use `auto` for the meter driver.

```shell
wmbusmeters auto:c1 MyTapWater auto 12345678 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
```

(The Multical21 and other meters use compressed telegrams, which means
that you might have to wait up to 8 telegrams (8*16 seconds) until you
receive a full length telegram which gives all the information needed
to decode the compressed telegrams.)

Example output:

`MyTapWater   12345678     6.388 m3     6.377 m3    0.000 m3/h     8°C    23°C   DRY(dry 22-31 days)     2018-03-05 12:02.50`

(Here the multical21 itself, is configured to send target volume, therefore the max flow is 0.000 m3/h.)

Example format json output:

```shell
wmbusmeters --format=json /dev/ttyUSB0:im871a MyTapWater multical21:c1 12345678 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF MyHeater multical302 22222222 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
```

```json
{"media":"cold water","meter":"multical21","name":"MyTapWater","id":"12345678","total_m3":6.388,"target_m3":6.377,"max_flow_m3h":0.000,"flow_temperature":8,"external_temperature":23,"current_status":"DRY","time_dry":"22-31 days","time_reversed":"","time_leaking":"","time_bursting":"","timestamp":"2018-02-08T09:07:22Z","device":"im871a[1234567]","rssi_dbm":-40}
```

```json
{"media":"heat","meter":"multical302","name":"MyHeater","id":"22222222","total_kwh":0.000,"total_volume_m3":0.000,"current_kw":"0.000","timestamp":"2018-02-08T09:07:22Z"}
```

Example format fields output and use tuned rtlsdr dongle with rtlwmbus.

```shell
wmbusmeters --format=fields 'rtlwmbus(ppm=72)' GreenhouseWater multical21:c1 33333333 NOKEY
```

```
GreenhouseTapWater;33333333;9999.099;77.712;0.000;11;31;;2018-03-05 12:10.24
```

You can select a subset of all available fields, where we also select to print the timestamp as a unix timestamp.
The timestamp field is UTC time for json and local time when hr and fields. To explicitly select utc you
can specify timestamp_utc and timestamp_lt for local time.

```shell
wmbusmeters --format=fields --selectfields=id,total_m3,timestamp_ut,timestamp_utc /dev/ttyUSB0:im871a GreenhouseWater multical21:c1 33333333 NOKEY
```

```
33333333;9999.099;1628434800;2021-08-08T15:00.00Z
```

You can list all available fields for a meter: `wmbusmeters --listfields=multical21`

You can list all meters: `wmbusmeters --listmeters`

You can search for meters: `wmbusmeters --listmeters=water` or `wmbusmeters --listmeters=q`

Eaxmple of using the shell command to publish to MQTT:

```shell
wmbusmeters --shell='HOME=/home/you mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t water -m "$METER_JSON"' /dev/ttyUSB0:im871a GreenhouseWater multical21:c1 33333333 NOKEY
```

Example of using the shell command to inject data into postgresql database:

```shell
wmbusmeters --shell="psql waterreadings -c \"insert into readings values ('\$METER_ID',\$METER_TOTAL_M3,'\$METER_TIMESTAMP') \" " /dev/ttyUSB0:amb8465 MyColdWater multical21:c1 12345678 NOKEY
```

(It is much easier to add shell commands in the conf file since you do not need to quote the quotes.)

You can have multiple shell commands and they will be executed in the order you gave them on the command line.

To list the shell env variables available for a meter, run `wmbusmeters --listenvs=multical21` which outputs:

```
METER_JSON
METER_TYPE
METER_NAME
METER_ID
METER_TOTAL_M3
METER_TARGET_M3
METER_MAX_FLOW_M3H
METER_FLOW_TEMPERATURE_C
METER_EXTERNAL_TEMPERATURE_C
METER_CURRENT_STATUS
METER_TIME_DRY
METER_TIME_REVERSED
METER_TIME_LEAKING
METER_TIME_BURSTING
METER_TIMESTAMP
```

(If you have supplied `--field_floor=5` then you will also see `METER_floor` in the list)

Note that the `METER_TIMESTAMP` and the timestamp in the json output, is in UTC format, this is not your localtime.
However the hr and fields output will print your localtime.

You can add `shell=commandline` to a meter file stored in `wmbusmeters.d`, then this meter will use
this shell command instead of the command stored in `wmbusmeters.conf`.

You can use `--debug` to get both verbose output and the actual data bytes sent back and forth with the wmbus usb dongle.

If the meter does not use encryption of its meter data, then enter NOKEY on the command line.

```shell
wmbusmeters --format=json --meterfiles /dev/ttyUSB0:im871a:c1 MyTapWater multical21:c1 12345678 NOKEY
```

# Using wmbusmeters in a pipe

```shell
rtl_sdr -f 868.625M -s 1600000 - 2>/dev/null | rtl_wmbus -s | wmbusmeters --format=json stdin:rtlwmbus MyMeter auto 12345678 NOKEY | ...more processing...
```

Or you can send rtl_wmbus formatted telegrams using nc over UDP to wmbusmeters.
```shell
rtl_sdr -f 868.95M -s 1600000 - 2>/dev/null | rtl_wmbus -p s -a | nc -u localhost 4444
```

And receive the telegrams with nc spawned by wmbusmeters.
```shell
wmbusmeters 'rtlwmbus:CMD(nc -lku 4444)'
```

Or start nc explicitly in a pipe.
```shell
nc -lku 4444 | wmbusmeters stdin:rtlwmbus
```

# Decoding hex string telegrams

If you have a single telegram as hex, which you want decoded, you do not need to create a simulation file,
you can just supply the telegram as a hex string on the command line.

```shell
wmbusmeters 234433300602010014007a8e0000002f2f0efd3a1147000000008e40fd3a341200000000
```

which will output:
```
No meters configured. Printing id:s of all telegrams heard!
Received telegram from: 00010206
          manufacturer: (LAS) Lansen Systems, Sweden (0x3033)
                  type: Other (0x00)
                   ver: 0x14
                driver: lansenpu
```

You can of course decode the meter on the fly:

```shell
wmbusmeters --format=json 234433300602010014007a8e0000002f2f0efd3a1147000000008e40fd3a341200000000 MyCounter auto 00010206 NOKEY
```

which will output:

```
{"media":"other","meter":"lansenpu","name":"MyCounter","id":"00010206","a_counter":4711,"b_counter":1234,"timestamp":"2021-09-12T08:45:52Z"}
```

You can also pipe the hex into wmbusmeters like this:

```shell
echo 234433300602010014007a8e0000002f2f0efd3a1147000000008e40fd3a341200000000 | ./build/wmbusmeters --silent --format=json stdin:hex MyCounter auto 00010206 NOKEY
```

or read hex data from a a file, `wmbusmeters myfile.txt:hex`

Any non-hex characters are ignored when using the suffix `:hex`. However when the hex string is
supplied on the command line it must be a proper hex string with no spaces.

When a telegram is supplied on the command line, then any valid dll crcs will be automatically removed,
like when the telegram is suppled in a simulation file.

You can analyze a telegram, this is useful when developing new drivers or trying
to find which driver is the best fit for an unknown mfct,type,ver combo.

```shell
wmbusmeters --analyze 3E44A5119035246141047A1A0030052F2F#0C06026301000C13688609040B3B0802000C2B220000F00A5A71020A5E72020AA61800004C0636370100426CBF25
```

Fields marked with `C!` (and green background) are content that is understood and put to use in the json. For example:
```
019 C!: 02630100 ("total_energy_consumption_kwh":16302)
```
Which shows the telegram raw data bytes and the json field into which the decoded value was presented.
Fields marked with `C?` (and red background) are content that is not understood nor used in the json.

To force a driver use: `--analyze=<driver>` to supply a decryption key: `--analyze=<key>` and to do both:
`--analyze=<key>:<driver>`


You can run the analyze functionality online here: [wmbusmeters.org](https://wmbusmeters.org)

# Additional tools

If you have a Kamstrup meter and you have received a KEM file and its
password from your supplier, then you can use `python2 utils/kem-import.py`
[utils/kem-import.py](utils/kem-import.py) to extract meter
information from that file (including the AES key) and to create
corresponding meter files in wmbusmeters' config directory.

You can also use the XMLExtract Java program. `javac utils/XMLExtract`
and then `java -cp utils XMLExtract` to print the key on the command line.

You can run wmbusmeters with `--logtelegrams` to get log output that can
be placed in a simulation.txt file. You can then run wmbusmeters and
instead of an usb device, you provide the `simulation.txt` file as
argument. See test.sh for more info.

If you do not specify any meters on the command line, then wmbusmeters
will listen and print the header information of any telegram it hears.

and adds the user `wmbusmeters` with no login account.

# Common problems

If wmbusmeters detects no device, but you know you have plugged in your wmbus dongle, then
run with `--verbose` to get more information on why the devices are not detected.
Typically this is because you are not in the dialout (for usb-serial dongles) or plugdev (for rtlsdr) group.

Run `sudo make install` to add the current user to the dialout group and the wmbusmeters group.

If the daemon has started then the wmbus device will be taken and you cannot start wmbusmeters manually.

To run manually, first make sure the daemon is stopped `sudo systemctl stop wmbusmeters`
if this hangs, then do `sudo killall -9 wmbusmetersd` and/or `sudo killall -9 wmbusmeters`.

## How to receive telegrams over longer distances

I only have personal experience of the im871a,amb8465 and an rtlsdr
compatible dongle.  The commercial dongles (im871a,amb8464) receive
well despite having tiny antennas inside the dongle. However the
reception range is limited by walls and you must definitely get quite
close to the meter if it is mounted underground in a concrete tube.

The rtlsdr/rtl-wmbus solution seems to work for a lot of users, but it
does use more cpu-power since it decodes the radio traffic in
software. Range seems to be similar to the other dongles, despite the
antenna being much larger.

At least one professional collector use the same commercial dongles,
but the versions with an external antenna connector, into which they
attach a radio amplifier for the proper frequency, and then a larger
antennna. This makes it possible to receive telegrams from meters
underground and over larger distances.

## Non-standard baud rate set for AMB8465 USB stick

Wmbusmeters expects the serial baud rate for the AMB8465 USB stick to be 9600 8n1.
If you have used another tool and changed the baud rate to something else
you need to restore the baud rate to 9600 8n1. You can do that with that other tool,
or you can try wmbusmeters-admin and select `Reset wmbus receives`
this command try all potential baud rates and send the factory reset command.
Then you have to unplug and reinsert the dongle.

If you like to send the bytes manually, the correct bytes are:

* Factory reset of the settings: `0xFF1100EE`
* Reset the stick to apply the factory defaults: `0xFF0500FA` this is not necessary if you unplug and reinsert the dongle.

# How to add a new driver

Drivers are self contained source code files named `src/driver_xyz.cc`
They register themselves at startup. The source file also contains the necessary tests for that driver.

Read more here: [doc/CreateDriver.md](doc/CreateDriver.md)

# Caveat

If you do not get proper readings from the meters with non-standard protocols. apator162, mkradio3, vario451
then you have to open an issue here and help out by logging a lot of messages and reverse engineer them
even more..... :-/

# Good free documents on the wireless mbus protocol standard EN 13757

https://oms-group.org/

There is also a lot of wmbus protocol implementation details that
are missing. They will be added to the program as we figure out
how the meters send their data.
